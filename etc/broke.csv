deVaucouleurs profile,"The radial distribution of flux of an astronomical source that is characterized as: 
I(r)=I0exp(7.67(r/re)1/4) 
An elliptical version of this profile can be fit to every detected source, yielding the deVaucouleurs parameters. See the page on Measurement in the LSST Stack for details.",Sci,,
